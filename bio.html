  <p class="par"> As a third year Computer Information Systems
    student at CSU Chico I can proudly say that I have a strong
  background in computing. I am proficent in multiple languages
  such as C++, Java, SQL, Swift also a bit of HTML as well as CSS.
   I've also done an internship with Enloe Medical center as a
   Information Services intern where I did various tasks such as IT
   support, data entry, researching and implementing information
   privacy as well provide project management assistance.

    <p class="par">
      What motivated me to take this course was not because it was
      required but because I think that web development is a really
      important language to know. I have a bit of web development
      experience behind me I used to have my own personal website
      but is now defunct due to high maintenance cost (but I still
      own the Domain) I also use HTML code in my listings
       when I sell things on eBay to spruce up the appeal behind <thead>
         item I was selling.
